**About me**

In 2020, [Defined.ai](https://www.defined.ai/) offered me a position as a Linguist on an AI project. When I started to work for the company, I realized that I wanted to learn more about technology. 

It was the beginning of a new learning journey that also included:

✅ an MBA in Digital Business; 

✅ more than 500 Data Science training classes watched; 
 
✅ hundreds of YouTube videos and tutorials, podcasts, and articles.

I spent 2021 getting an overview of Data Science. Yes, an overview! 😁

Now it’s time to transform this knowledge into a portfolio. 🚀
